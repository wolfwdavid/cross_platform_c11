TextBoxInput.swift

# TextBox Input Mode

Provides a native text editing experience for terminal input that
terminal emulators typically struggle with.

## Rationale

ghostty (libghostty)'s key input path has limitations with IME,
macOS standard keybindings, and system clipboard operations. TextBox
handles these natively via AppKit and sends only committed text to the
terminal. Shell history, tab completion, and Ctrl+key commands are
transparently forwarded while keeping focus in the TextBox, so users
get a seamless experience without being aware of two input modes.

## Features

### F1. Native Text Editing
Full macOS standard operations: Cmd+A (select all), Cmd+C/V/X (copy/paste/cut),
Cmd+Z/Shift+Cmd+Z (undo/redo), Option+Arrow (word navigation), mouse selection,
double-click word select, triple-click line select.

### F2. IME Support
Input methods (Japanese, Chinese, Korean, etc.) work correctly via NSTextView's
built-in marked text handling. Composition is not interrupted by terminal updates.

### F3. Multi-line Input
Insert newlines for multi-line text submission.
Default: Enter = send, Shift+Enter = newline (reversible in settings).

### F4. Auto-grow
Text box grows with content (1–8 visible lines), then scrolls internally.
Shrinks back to minimum after submit.

### F5. Key Routing
All rules are defined in `TextBoxKeyRouting` as a centralized table.
See the rule table above that enum for the full specification.
- Rule 1: Emacs editing (Ctrl+A/E/F/B/N/P/K/H) — handled by NSTextView
- Rule 2: Ctrl+other — forwarded to terminal (keep focus)
- Rule 3: "/" prefix — forwarded to terminal + focus terminal (empty, Claude Code/Codex)
- Rule 4: "@" prefix — forwarded to terminal + focus terminal (empty, Claude Code/Codex)
- Rule 5: "?" key — forwarded as raw event (empty, Claude Code/Codex, keep focus)
- Rule 6/7: Return/Shift+Return — submit or newline (setting-dependent)
- Rule 8: Escape — focus terminal or send ESC (setting-dependent)
- Rule 9: Tab, Backspace — forwarded to terminal when empty (keep focus).
  Arrow keys are *not* forwarded; they always drive NSTextView cursor
  movement, even when the TextBox is empty (Option B decision).
- Rule 10: Fallback — default TextBox text input

### F6. Theme Sync
Matches terminal background/foreground colors (via Ghostty runtime config),
font size, background-opacity, and selection colors (inverted fg/bg).

### F7. Toggle Shortcut
Cmd+Option+B to toggle display or focus (configurable in Settings).
Default behavior: Toggle Focus (keep TextBox visible, swap focus).
Scope: all tabs toggle simultaneously.

### F8. Drag & Drop
Drop files/folders from Finder onto the TextBox to insert shell-escaped paths.
Multiple files are space-separated. Dropped text is selected for easy review.

### F9. Placeholder
Shows dynamic hint text when empty ("Commands or prompts here…")
with the current send key (Return or Shift+Return) based on settings.

### F10. Send Button
Paperplane icon button with hover/press highlight. Submits TextBox content.

### F11. Focus Guards
Terminal focus-restore mechanisms (ensureFocus, applyFirstResponder) skip
stealing focus when an InputTextView is the current first responder.

### F12. App Detection
Detects Claude Code and Codex by matching terminal tab title (regex,
case-insensitive). Claude Code is also detected when the title starts
with "✱" or "✳" (icon prefix) or "⠂" (thinking indicator).
Used to enable prefix/key forwarding (Rules 3–5).

### F13. Bracket Paste Submission
Text is sent via PTY bracket paste, then Return is sent as a separate
synthetic key event after a 200ms delay. This ensures apps using bracket
paste mode (zsh, Claude CLI) process the paste before receiving Return.

### F14. Per-panel State
Each TerminalPanel has independent isTextBoxActive, textBoxContent, and
inputTextView reference. Switching tabs preserves TextBox state.

## Settings (Settings > TextBox Input)

TextBox is hidden by default; Cmd+Option+B summons and dismisses it per
panel (the only toggle — there is no global "Enable Mode" setting).

- **Send on Return**: On = Return sends / Shift+Enter inserts newline,
  Off = Enter inserts newline / Shift+Enter sends (default: on)
- **Escape Key**: Send ESC Key or Focus Terminal (default: Send ESC Key)
- **Keyboard Shortcut (Cmd+Option+B)**: Toggle Display or Toggle Focus
  (default: Toggle Focus). Key is customizable in Keyboard Shortcuts settings.

## Test Plan

### T1. Settings
- [ ] T1.1  Default values: enterToSend=true, escape=sendEscape, shortcut=toggleFocus
- [ ] T1.2  Toggle each setting and verify it persists across app restart
- [ ] T1.3  Reset All restores all settings to defaults

### T2. Basic Text Editing (F1)
- [ ] T2.1  Type text and verify it appears in the TextBox
- [ ] T2.2  Cmd+A selects all text

- [ ] T2.5  Option+Left/Right moves by word
- [ ] T2.6  Mouse click positions cursor
- [ ] T2.7  Mouse drag selects text
- [ ] T2.8  Double-click selects word, triple-click selects line

### T3. IME (F2)
- [ ] T3.1  Japanese input (Hiragana → Kanji conversion) completes correctly
- [ ] T3.2  Chinese pinyin input works
- [ ] T3.3  Korean input works
- [ ] T3.4  IME composition is not interrupted by terminal title updates

### T4. Multi-line & Auto-grow (F3, F4)
- [ ] T4.1  Shift+Return inserts newline (enterToSend=on)
- [ ] T4.2  Return inserts newline (enterToSend=off)
- [ ] T4.3  TextBox height grows from 2 lines up to 8 lines
- [ ] T4.4  Beyond 8 lines, content scrolls internally
- [ ] T4.5  After submit, TextBox shrinks back to minimum height

### T5. Key Routing — Emacs (F5, Rule 1)
- [ ] T5.1  Ctrl+A moves to beginning of line
- [ ] T5.2  Ctrl+E moves to end of line
- [ ] T5.3  Ctrl+F moves forward, Ctrl+B moves backward
- [ ] T5.4  Ctrl+N moves down, Ctrl+P moves up (multi-line)
- [ ] T5.5  Ctrl+K kills to end of line
- [ ] T5.6  Ctrl+H deletes backward

### T6. Key Routing — Terminal Forwarding (F5, Rules 2–5, 9)
- [ ] T6.1  Ctrl+C sends SIGINT to terminal (focus stays in TextBox)
- [ ] T6.2  Ctrl+D sends EOF to terminal
- [ ] T6.3  Ctrl+Z sends SIGTSTP to terminal
- [ ] T6.4  Ctrl+L clears terminal screen
- [ ] T6.5  "/" in empty TextBox + Claude Code → forwarded, focus moves to terminal
- [ ] T6.6  "/" in non-empty TextBox → typed as text
- [ ] T6.7  "/" in empty TextBox + plain shell → typed as text
- [ ] T6.8  "@" in empty TextBox + Claude Code → forwarded, focus moves to terminal
- [ ] T6.9  "@" in empty TextBox + Codex → forwarded, focus moves to terminal
- [ ] T6.10 "?" in empty TextBox + Claude Code → forwarded as key event, focus stays
- [ ] T6.11 "?" in non-empty TextBox → typed as text
- [ ] T6.12 Arrow Up/Down in empty TextBox → cursor stays in TextBox (Option B: no shell-history forwarding)
- [ ] T6.13 Tab in empty TextBox → tab completion in terminal
- [ ] T6.14 Backspace in empty TextBox → forwarded to terminal
- [ ] T6.15 Arrow keys in non-empty TextBox → cursor movement within TextBox (same as empty; no forwarding)

### T7. Submit & Escape (F5, Rules 6–8)
- [ ] T7.1  Return submits text (enterToSend=on)
- [ ] T7.2  Shift+Return submits text (enterToSend=off)
- [ ] T7.3  Submitted text appears in terminal with command execution
- [ ] T7.4  TextBox is cleared after submit
- [ ] T7.5  Empty submit sends just Return to terminal
- [ ] T7.6  Escape sends ESC key to terminal (escape=sendEscape)
- [ ] T7.7  Escape moves focus to terminal (escape=focusTerminal)
- [ ] T7.8  Multi-line text is sent correctly via bracket paste

### T8. Theme Sync (F6)

- [ ] T8.4  Selection color is inverted (fg on bg)
- [ ] T8.5  Font size matches terminal font size
- [ ] T8.6  Cursor (insertion point) color matches foreground
- [ ] T8.7  Theme changes are reflected immediately

### T9. Toggle Shortcut (F7)
- [ ] T9.1  Cmd+Opt+B shows TextBox when hidden (toggleDisplay mode)
- [ ] T9.2  Cmd+Opt+B hides TextBox when shown (toggleDisplay mode)
- [ ] T9.3  Cmd+Opt+B moves focus to TextBox when unfocused (toggleFocus mode)
- [ ] T9.4  Cmd+Opt+B moves focus to terminal when TextBox focused (toggleFocus mode)
- [ ] T9.5  Toggle applies to all tabs simultaneously
- [ ] T9.6  Custom shortcut key works after changing in Settings
- [ ] T9.7  New terminal panes start with the TextBox hidden; Cmd+Opt+B summons it

### T10. Drag & Drop (F8)
- [ ] T10.1  Drop single file → shell-escaped path inserted
- [ ] T10.2  Drop multiple files → space-separated escaped paths
- [ ] T10.3  Drop folder → folder path inserted
- [ ] T10.4  Paths with spaces/special chars are properly escaped
- [ ] T10.5  Green "+" badge appears when dragging over TextBox
- [ ] T10.6  Dropped text is selected for review
- [ ] T10.7  Drop onto terminal area still works normally

### T11. Focus Guards (F11)

///    would convert them into selectors and they wouldn't reach the

///
/// 2. **`doCommandBySelector`** — handles interpreted commands (arrows,
///    Tab, Backspace, Enter, Escape). These are forwarded to the terminal
///    only when the TextBox is empty (except Enter/Escape which are always
///    handled). Using `doCommandBySelector` instead of raw `keyDown`
